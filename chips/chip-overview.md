## Description
This folder contains all firmware representaions of chips I have written. They all have links to the chip datasheet or manufacturer. They also if aplicable have a list possible improvements or functions that still need to be implemented. The info.md in every subfolder also gives an explaination of the general use of the chip and libary.
